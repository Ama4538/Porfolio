    "statement": "I'm a Computer Science student at George Mason University with a passion for web development. I enjoy creating websites that are both functional and user-friendly. My approach to coding and web development is a human-first approach, where the end user's satisfaction matters the most. Through my coursework, I've developed a strong foundation in data structures, object-oriented programming, and software engineering. Outside the classroom, I'm always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks, applying what I learn to personal projects to help reinforce my understanding. When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, walking a trail, or playing video games. I believe that a curious and collaborative mindset is key to building meaningful solutions, and I'm excited to continue growing as a developer while creating tools that make a difference.",
